            Strategy and vision form the foundation for quantum-safe transition. Without executive sponsorship recognizing the quantum threat, PQC migration will lack resources and priority. The Dutch Migration Handbook identifies organizational personas ranging from 'unaware' to 'frontrunner,' with most European organizations currently in early awareness stages. Strategic planning must address the Mosca inequality: if data sensitivity lifespan plus migration time exceeds time until cryptographically relevant quantum computers (CRQC), action is required now.
          assessment: |
            Key Probes:
              - Can executives articulate the quantum threat to PKI operations?
              - Is PQC mentioned in strategic planning documents?
              - Has the organization assessed its Mosca inequality position?
              - What regulatory deadlines has the organization identified as applicable?
              - Is budget allocated specifically for PQC activities?
            
            Critical Transitions:
              - Level 2→3: 'Awareness to Action' - formal strategy incorporation, executive sponsorship extended, working group established
              - Level 4→5: 'Execution to Leadership' - competitive positioning, ecosystem contribution, crypto-agility as ongoing capability
            
            Warning Signs:
              - 'We'll address it when vendors are ready' - vendor timelines may not align with regulatory requirements
              - No executive able to discuss quantum risk - indicates awareness gap at leadership level
              - PQC treated as purely technical matter - missing governance and strategic dimensions
              - Assuming extended timeline - UK NCSC sets migration milestones through 2028/2031/2035; financial sector guidance warns risk could materialize within 10-15 years or sooner
            
            Evidence Examples by Level:
              - Level 2: Email/meeting notes showing PQC discussed; informal awareness materials
              - Level 3: Board presentation on quantum risk; PQC working group charter; budget line item for PQC; Mosca analysis document
              - Level 4: Quarterly PQC steering committee minutes; ERM risk register with quantum risk entry; KRI dashboard showing PQC metrics; multi-year migration budget approval
              - Level 5: Published thought leadership; standards body participation records; regulator consultation responses; crypto-agility architecture documentation

          guidance: |
            RFC 3647 governs Certificate Policy and CPS structure. PQC migration requires fundamental policy updates: algorithm specifications must expand to include NIST FIPS 203/204/205 (ML-KEM, ML-DSA, SLH-DSA), deprecation schedules must align with SP 800-131A Rev 3 and regional requirements, hybrid vs pure PQC strategy must be documented, and Cryptographic Bill of Materials (CBOM) requirements are emerging as compliance necessity.
            Multi-jurisdiction complexity creates policy challenges: European regulators (BSI, ANSSI) require hybrid signatures during transition, while CNSA 2.0 recommends pure PQ for US National Security Systems. Key management policies must address larger key sizes, HSM PQC support requirements, and stateful hash-based signature state management where applicable.
          assessment: |
            Key Probes:
              - When was CP/CPS last updated? Does it reference PQC algorithms?
              - Does approved algorithm list include deprecation dates?
              - Can the organization produce a CBOM?
              - How does Key Management Policy address PQC key sizes and HSM requirements?
              - How are regional regulatory differences (EU hybrid vs US pure PQ) addressed?
            
            Warning Signs:
              - CP/CPS last updated before August 2024 (pre-NIST standardization)
              - Algorithm list lacks deprecation dates
              - 'We'll update when vendors support PQC' - reactive rather than proactive stance
              - No awareness of regional requirement differences
              - CBOM mentioned but no artifacts produced
            
            Evidence Examples by Level:
              - Level 2: Internal memo acknowledging CP/CPS needs updating; informal algorithm inventory
              - Level 3: CP/CPS amendment project plan; approved algorithm list with PQC entries and deprecation dates; CBOM generation tool deployed; hybrid strategy decision document
              - Level 4: Published CP/CPS with PQC provisions; algorithm governance meeting minutes; CBOM integrated with CI/CD pipeline; compliance audit report including algorithm verification
              - Level 5: Policy templates shared with industry; algorithm governance anticipating draft standards; CBOM feeding into ERM dashboard; multi-jurisdiction policy variant management system

                NIST CSWP 39 establishes crypto-agility as fundamental to PQC transition. At base weight 2, this requirement is significantly underweighted for quantum readiness assessment. The 2.5× multiplier elevates its effective contribution to match its criticality for PQC without altering core PKIMM.
